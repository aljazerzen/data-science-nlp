abstract = {The identification of Hate Speech in Social Media is of great importance and receives much attention in the text classification community. There is a huge demand for research for languages other than English. The HASOC track intends to stimulate development in Hate Speech for Hindi, German and English. Three datasets were developed from Twitter and Facebook and made available. Binary classification and more fine-grained subclasses were offered in 3 subtasks. For all subtasks, 321 experiments were submitted. The approaches used most often were LSTM networks processing word embedding input. The performance of the best system for identification of Hate Speech for English, Hindi, and German was a Marco-F1 score of 0.78, 0.81 and 0.61, respectively.},

abstract = {A quality annotated corpus is essential to research. Despite the re- cent focus of the Web science community on cyberbullying research, the community lacks standard benchmarks. This paper provides both a quality annotated corpus and an o ensive words lexicon capturing di erent types of harassment content: (i) sexual, (ii) racial, (iii) appearance-related, (iv) intellectual, and (v) political1. We rst crawled data from Twitter using this content-tailored o ensive lexicon. As mere presence of an o ensive word is not a reliable indicator of harassment, human judges annotated tweets for the presence of harassment. Our corpus consists of 25,000 annotated tweets for the ve types of harassment content and is available on the Git repository2.},
